# TurtleSim

**Install guide**: 

Download the repository as a Zip-file or if you have Git you can run the following command in a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/GeorgJunker/TurtleSim.git

You now need to extract the Zip-file (don't mind this if you git cloned).

Open up a terminal window and navigate into the TurtleSim folder.

    cd path/to/TurtleSim

In your terminal run the following command while inside the main directory:

    pip install .

The package is now installed and ready for use.

**Use guide**:

Running the following command in your terminal:

    TurtleSim <input_file> 

Produces an output with identical name.

Eg. running '_TurtleSim test.inp_' produces test.out.
