# TurtleSim

**!!! TurtleSim requires NumPy !!!**

If you don't have NumPy installed, check out https://numpy.org/install/.

**Install guide**: 

Download the repository as a Zip-file or if you have Git you can run the following command in a terminal:

    git clone https://github.com/GeorgJunker/TurtleSim.git

If you manually downloaded the Zip-file then you need to extract it. 

Once extracted then you are ready to use TurtleSim.

**Use guide**:

**Step 1: Create your input file**

Input files must end with ".inp" in order for TurtleSim to find the files. 

A premade input file is included in the repository (input.inp). It includes all available settings.

**Step 2: Run the executable TurtleSim**

Run either TurtleSim.bat (Windows) or TurtleSim.sh (Mac) depending on your OS. 

Running the executable will gather all input files in your current directory.

It will run a simulation on each input file.

**Step 3: Check your output**

TurtleSim will automatically create output files, which be named after its associated input file.

_E.g. input.inp will result in input.out._

The output files can be opened by any text editor.
